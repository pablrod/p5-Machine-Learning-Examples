# Machine Learning Examples

This repo contains examples of diferent machine learning algorithms. 
The examples try to illustrate something or to be useful for teaching.
That is, the examples are for *human learning*.

## Dependencies

Every example is independent from the others but you need to install
some dependencies. I recomend using `cpanm`.

For example:
```bash
cpanm Algorithm::DecisionTree
```
